This repo is the RoR backend for the rebuild of my capstone project from Actualize Boot Camp.

The application maintains the original concept - a fitness app that will allow users to browse different exercises and create a routine using wichever exercises they'd like. With that said, my schema is quite different this time. I plan on adding a long list of new features as well as making modifications to already exisiting/functional features of my original application.

This is a work in progress. While searching for a job opportunity in tech, it's important to me that I continue to refine my skills and learn new things. This readme will be updated as I deem appropraite.
